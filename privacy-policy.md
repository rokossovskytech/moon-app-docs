This Privacy Policy describes how Moon (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our iOS application.

By using Moon, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.

1. Information We Collect
Health Data (via Apple HealthKit)

Moon integrates with Apple HealthKit to read sleep analysis data, heart rate, and related health metrics from your Apple Watch or iPhone.

These data are used only within the App to display analytics, insights, and trends about your sleep.

We do not send your HealthKit data to any external servers or third parties.

Health data never leave your device unless explicitly shared by you through Apple Health’s sharing features.

Local Data

Sleep sessions, alarms, and preferences are stored locally on your device using Apple Core Data.

These data are not uploaded to any external service.

Audio and Media

The App uses Firebase Storage to provide access to relaxation melodies and sounds.

Playback activity (e.g., which melody you play) may be measured anonymously through Firebase Analytics.

Analytics and Usage Data

We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage statistics (e.g., feature usage, crash reports) to improve app performance and stability.

No personally identifiable information is collected through analytics.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected data to:

Display and analyze your sleep trends and quality;

Manage and trigger alarms;

Provide relaxation sounds and music;

Improve user experience and app functionality;

Communicate with you if you contact support.

3. Data Storage and Security

All sensitive data (including HealthKit data and sleep history) are stored only on your device.

We use Apple’s secure frameworks (HealthKit, Core Data, Notification Center) to ensure privacy and data integrity.

We never share, sell, or rent your personal data to third parties.

4. Contact and Support

You may contact us regarding this Privacy Policy or any privacy-related inquiries at:

Each of these services has its own privacy policy and complies with relevant data protection laws.

Local data (alarms, preferences): deleted when you uninstall the app.

Analytics data: retained by Firebase according to Google’s privacy policy.
